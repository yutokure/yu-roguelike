        <h1>15. Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Q1. The screen looks wrong. What should I do?</h2>
            <p>Cached assets may be interfering. Reload the page (Windows: <code>Ctrl + F5</code>, Mac: <code>Cmd + Shift + R</code>).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Q2. I edited data and now the game throws errors.</h2>
            <p>Most issues come from missing commas or closing quotes in JSON. Use your editor’s syntax checker to catch them.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Q3. Can I play on mobile?</h2>
            <p>Yes. The UI is responsive, though rotating the device to landscape mode improves usability on smaller screens.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Q4. My file changes do not appear.</h2>
            <p>Make sure you saved the file and cleared the cache. After saving, refresh the browser. If nothing changes, open the
                developer tools to check for errors.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Q5. SP and skills are unavailable.</h2>
            <p>SP unlocks at player level 100. After that, movement, enemy defeats, MiniExp rewards, and offering recovery items all
                add SP. Some skills are disabled in dungeons that exceed your level by 8 or more—read the descriptions in the skill
                modal before activating them.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Q6. I keep dying to hunger damage.</h2>
            <p>In dungeons with a recommended level of 300 or more, satiety drops every turn. At 0 you take hunger damage based on max
                HP. When the gauge falls below 30%, either head back early or enable auto-use in the status modal so potions switch
                to the “Eat” action at 40% or less. If you plan to continue exploring, return to the selection screen to refill
                satiety once damage starts ticking.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Q7. Where can I review passive orbs?</h2>
            <p>Passive orbs drop from high-score MiniExp rewards or challenging bosses. They equip automatically, stacking up to three
                per type for bonuses such as damage reduction and ailment resistance. Review their effects at the bottom of the
                status modal (“Passive Effects”) or via the icons below the status card during exploration.</p>
