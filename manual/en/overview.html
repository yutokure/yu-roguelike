            <h2>2.1 What Is Yu Roguelike?</h2>
            <p>
                Yu Roguelike is a browser-based adventure where you pick a dungeon and dive into a procedurally
                generated expedition. The game runs entirely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so any modern browser can
                play it without extra installs. Choose your dungeon type and difficulty to meet new enemies and items
                tailored to each run.
