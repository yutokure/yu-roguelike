            <h2>9.4 Making the Most of MiniExp Rewards</h2>
            <p>
                MiniExp scores convert not only to in-game currency but also to special materials and title points. Increasing the
                difficulty raises the reward multiplier, yet failing midway reduces the bonus. Work up from a level you can clear
                consistently.
            </p>
            <p>
                From level 100 onward, 1% of the experience earned via MiniExp automatically converts into SP, helping you charge
                skill gauges for dungeon runs. The score screen and dungeon HUD display your SP total, making it easy to grind
                until you reach the desired amount. High-score rewards also include passive orbs that grant damage reduction or
                status resistances, up to three per category.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EXP Boost:</strong> Consecutive plays build combo multipliers that add EXP to the main game.</li>
                <li><strong>Material Tickets:</strong> Earn random crafting materials at specific score thresholds—useful for Block
                    Dimension builds and gear upgrades.</li>
                <li><strong>Title Tasks:</strong> Complete game-specific challenges to unlock title panels and permanent bonuses.</li>
            </ul>
