        <p>
            This guide is written for both players and creators. Each chapter favours short explanations and offers
            extra notes or illustrations whenever a technical term appears, so you can read at a relaxed pace.

            <h2>How the Chapters Are Organised</h2>
            <p>
                The manual follows a gradual path from introduction to advanced techniques. Beginners can read
                sequentially from the top without being overwhelmed, while experienced users can jump straight to
                the sections they need without losing context.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever a specialist term appears, we add a short definition and a link to the glossary or appendix
                so you can explore the topic further if you wish.

            <h2>Helpful Reading Habits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Progress step by step:</strong> After each chapter, jot down a quick note to confirm what you understood.</li>
                <li><strong>Work hands-on:</strong> Open the actual project files while you read to cement the concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Look up terms immediately:</strong> The glossary keeps later chapters easy to follow.</li>
                <li><strong>Backtrack whenever you need:</strong> Chapters reference each other, so revisiting earlier sections is encouraged.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Using It as a Reference</h2>
            <p>
                Even after a full read-through, you can quickly check a specific topic thanks to the headlines and
                bullet lists in each chapter. Use your browserâ€™s search (<code>Ctrl + F</code> / <code>Cmd + F</code>) to find
                keywords instantly.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you still have questions, visit the Frequently Asked Questions section or the community notes. When
                answers are hard to find, jot them down with the Memo Pad tool so you can follow up later.
