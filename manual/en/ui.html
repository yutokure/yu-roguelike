            <h2>6.1 Title Screen</h2>
            <p>
                The top of the title screen shows the game logo and a large selection card. Use the card to choose the
                <strong>difficulty</strong>, <strong>world</strong>, and <strong>dungeon</strong> in that order before you begin your
                run.

            <h2>6.2 Tab Overview</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard:</strong> Pick from the regular catalogue of dungeons.</li>
                <li><strong>Block Dimension:</strong> Assemble dungeons from multiple block presets.</li>
                <li><strong>MiniExp:</strong> Review the elements you have unlocked through mini-games.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>6.3 Dungeon Detail Card</h2>
            <p>
                After you select a world and dungeon, a detail card appears on the right. It lists the damage multiplier,
                recommended level, and a short description. When you are ready, press <strong>Enter Dungeon</strong> to start
                exploring.
            </p>

            <h2>6.4 Block Dimension Screen</h2>
            <p>
                The Block Dimension tab lets you type a <strong>NESTED</strong> value and choose blocks from several lists.
                Your selections appear in the preview panel at the bottom. When you are unsure which layout to try, use the
                randomise button to shuffle the candidates.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>6.5 Exploration Toolbar</h2>
            <p>
                The exploration screen displays a toolbar across the top. From left to right the buttons are
                <em>Return</em>, <em>Items</em>, <em>Skills</em>, <em>Status</em>, <em>Import</em>, and <em>Export</em>.
                Once the SP system is unlocked, the <strong>Skills</strong> button lights up and opens a panel where you can
                check your current SP and skill list. On mobile the toolbar supports horizontal scrolling—swipe left or right
                if you cannot see a button you need.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skills button:</strong> Opens and closes the skill modal. Use it to review available skills, the
                    remaining SP, and active durations.</li>
                <li><strong>Items button:</strong> Opens the item modal for consuming or offering healing and enhancement items.
                    The auto-item toggle in the top-right corner of the modal enables automatic use of the configured
                    potion or food whenever the conditions are met.</li>
                <li><strong>Status button:</strong> Shows your current attributes, status ailments, and active skill effects.
                    The card overlay indicates whether auto-use is on or off so that you can confirm the configuration during
                    a run.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>6.6 Status Card and SP / Satiety Bars</h2>
            <p>
                The card on the left-hand side of the exploration screen displays your core stats—HP, experience, attack, and
                defence—alongside the SP gauge unlocked at level 100 and the satiety gauge that appears in dungeons with a
                recommended level of 300 or higher. The SP bar is purple, the satiety bar is yellow, and both shrink as the
                value decreases. Their numerical values are shown at the bottom of the card.
            </p>
            <p>
                You gain SP by moving, defeating enemies, earning MiniExp rewards, or offering recovery items. The maximum SP
                is 100 at level 100, 150 at level 250, 200 at level 500, and increases by 50 every additional 500 levels. The
                satiety gauge decreases by 1 each turn. When it reaches 0 you take hunger damage based on your maximum HP. If
                you enable auto-use from the status modal, configured potions automatically switch to the “Eat” action and
                keep you topped up once the gauge falls below the threshold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both the status card and the status modal display <strong>status badges</strong> for domain crystals, skill
                effects, and ailments. The badge colour and icon are consistent—for example, <code>ATK↑</code> indicates an
                attack buff and <code>⇆</code> denotes damage inversion. Multiple badges are shown in the order the effects
                were applied, making it easier to decide which one to cleanse first.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>Dungeon Overlay</strong> in the top-right corner shows hazard badges. When darkness, poison mist,
                or noise are active the overlay lights up with a dedicated label. If you tackle a dungeon at least five levels
                above the recommendation, the label adds “(Suppressed)” and the badge becomes semi-transparent. Visual glitch
                effects only occur while the noise hazard is active and end immediately once suppression succeeds.
            </p>

            <h2>6.7 Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tab:</strong> Move between input fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Enter:</strong> Activate the focused button.</li>
                <li><strong>Esc:</strong> Close the current dialog if it supports keyboard dismissal.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>6.8 Accessibility Notes</h2>
            <p>
                All buttons and lists are fully keyboard-accessible and include ARIA attributes for screen-reader support.
                When customising the style, make sure the contrast ratio and focus outlines remain easy to distinguish.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="result-overlay">
            <h2>6.9 Result Overlay</h2>
            <p>
                When a run ends, the centre of the screen shows a translucent backdrop with a result card. The top of the card
                displays a badge for the outcome (clear, defeated, and so on), the title, and—when applicable—the cause of
                failure so you can review what happened at a glance.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Level:</strong> Shows the level at the start and end of the run as <code>Start → End (+/-Δ)</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Total EXP Gained:</strong> Lists the net experience earned during the expedition.</li>
                <li><strong>Total Damage Taken / Items Used:</strong> Summarises all damage received and how many recovery items
                    you consumed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The bottom of the card offers the primary actions. <strong>Return to Base</strong> sends you back to the
                selection screen. When conditions are met, a <strong>Retry</strong> button appears to the right so you can jump
                straight into the same dungeon. Keyboard focus defaults to Return to Base. Press Enter or Space to confirm, or
                Esc to trigger the same behaviour. On touch devices, simply tap the buttons.
            </p>
            <p class="small-note">All statistics displayed in the result overlay are added to the Achievements &amp; Statistics
                tracker and can be reviewed in exported saves under <code>achievements.stats.core</code>. For the gameplay
                flow, refer to <a href="how-to-play.html" target="manual-content">7. How to Play</a>.</p>
